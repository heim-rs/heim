> Cross-platform library for system information fetching

`heim` is an ongoing attempt to create the best tool for system information fetching
(ex., CPU, memory, disks or processes stats) in the Rust crates ecosystem.\
It targets to have at least the same functionality as
[psutil](https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil),
[gopsutil](https://github.com/shirou/gopsutil) or
[oshi](https://github.com/oshi/oshi) eventually.

Check [user guide](https://heim-rs.github.io/book/) to get more information
on the `heim` goals, integrations and showcases.

Why should I use `heim` instead of *{crate-name}*?
See the [comparison](https://github.com/heim-rs/heim/blob/master/COMPARISON.md) page.

Examples can be found [here](https://github.com/heim-rs/heim/tree/master/examples).

## Background

`heim` has a few key goals which define its development and public interface:

 1. [Async-first](https://heim-rs.github.io/book/async/index.html)
    with [tokio](https://tokio.rs) and [async-std](https://async.rs) support.\
    Bundled polyfill option could be used for other use cases, see [documentation](https://docs.rs/heim)
    for more details.
 2. [Cross-platform](https://heim-rs.github.io/book/coverage/index.html) with [platform-specific extensions](https://heim-rs.github.io/book/api/platform-specific.html).
 3. Modular design.
 4. Idiomatic and easy to use.

## Technical notes

`heim` requires Rust 1.45 or higher; this version is explicitly tested in CI
and may be bumped in any major or minor release as needed.\
Any changes to the supported minimum version will be called out in the
[release notes](https://github.com/heim-rs/heim/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## Platform support

Right now `heim` support [Tier 1](https://forge.rust-lang.org/platform-support.html#tier-1)
platforms (Linux, macOS, and Windows for `i686` and `x86_64`).
You can check the [GitHub projects page](https://github.com/heim-rs/heim/projects)
