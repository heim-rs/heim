//! This crate is a shim around various async runtimes with a fallback to sync operations.
//!
//! ## Why?
//!
//! It might be expected that an async library should be a runtime-agnostic thing,
//! but due to current ecosystem state it is not possible yet;
//! for example there is no async files I/O abstraction.
//!
//! Until then, this crate will provide the wrappers around the various reactors, if possible,
//! and end users may choose the implementation, which is compatible with their reactor.
//!
//! See also: https://github.com/heim-rs/heim/issues/75

// Note that `heim-runtime` is used for Linux only at the moment,
// so it is unnecessary to compile anything from here for other targets.
